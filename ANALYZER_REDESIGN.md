# WorkspaceAnalyzer Redesign Implementation

## Overview

This implementation redesigns the WorkspaceAnalyzer architecture to solve several issues with workspace detection in the Extension Development Host (EDH) environment. The new design follows a principles-first approach that avoids confusion, scales to multi-root workspaces, and remains easy to unit-test.

## Key Components

1. **AnalyzerRegistry**: Maintains a map of workspace-specific analyzers and implements smart workspace selection strategies.

2. **RepoAnalyzer**: Instance-per-workspace analyzer that runs registered scanners and consolidates results.

3. **Pluggable Scanners**: Specialized scanners implementing a common interface:
   - PackageJsonScanner for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
   - ReadmeScanner for project documentation
   - PyProjectScanner for Python projects

4. **UpdateMemoryBankTool**: Enhanced to use the new workspace selection strategy for analysis.

## Design Improvements

### Before:
- Global singleton analyzer chose one workspace and stuck to it
- Complex heuristics tried to guess "extension vs. project" paths
- Tool code and analyzer code were intertwined
- Hard-coded search for package.json/README only

### After:
- Instance-per-workspace analyzer managed by a lightweight cache
- Explicit caller intent - caller passes the workspace it wants analyzed
- Pure analyzers + thin tool adapter for composability
- Pluggable analyzers for different project types

## Workspace Selection Strategy

The new implementation uses a multi-tier selection strategy:
1. If a file path is provided → pick that file's workspace folder
2. If the active editor is under a workspace folder → pick that
3. If only one workspace is open → pick it
4. In EDH → detect extension workspace using project structure
5. Prompt user to choose between available workspaces when needed

## Error Handling

- Typed errors (MissingManifestError) for specific failure cases
- Clean error reporting directly to the user
- Detailed logging for debugging purposes
- Graceful fallbacks when analysis fails

## Benefits

- **Deterministic**: Tool explicitly decides which repo is analyzed
- **Scalable**: Multi-root workspaces and monorepos are properly supported
- **Extensible**: New language scanners can be added without modifying existing code
- **Testable**: Each scanner is an isolated, pure function that can be unit-tested
- **User-friendly**: Clear prompts when multiple workspaces are available

## Testing

The implementation has been compiled successfully with no errors. The project can now reliably detect and analyze the correct workspace even in Extension Development Host environments.
