Memory Bank provides seamless, persistent context and knowledge management for GitHub Copilot Chat using VS Code's Language Model Tools API.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Native GitHub Copilot Integration**: Tools appear directly in Copilot's agent mode
- **Automatic Tool Discovery**: Copilot automatically suggests relevant memory operations  
- **User Safety**: Built-in confirmation dialogs for all operations
- **Persistent Memory**: Maintains project context across editor restarts and chat sessions
- **Core Memory Files**: Auto-scaffolds a memory-bank directory with specialized files for different types of information
- **Knowledge Management**: Organizes project information into dedicated files with clear purposes
- **Four Working Modes**: Architect, Code, Ask, and Debug - each with specialized behaviors
- **Real-time Updates**: Monitors file changes and maintains cross-file consistency
- **Intelligent Mode Switching**: Automatically switches modes based on your input
- **Session Management**: Auto-synchronizes at the end of each session

## Language Model Tools

Memory Bank registers the following tools that GitHub Copilot can use automatically:

| Tool | Reference Name | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Update Active Context** | `#updateContext` | Set your current working focus |
| **Log Decision** | `#logDecision` | Record important architectural decisions |
| **Update Progress** | `#updateProgress` | Track done/doing/next items |
| **Show Memory** | `#showMemory` | Display memory bank file contents |
| **Update Memory Bank** | `#updateMemoryBank` | Sync memory with workspace state |
| **Switch Mode** | `#switchMode` | Change working mode (architect/code/ask/debug) |

## Usage with GitHub Copilot Chat

### Natural Language Interaction

Simply talk to GitHub Copilot Chat naturally, and it will automatically suggest using Memory Bank tools:

**Examples:**
- "I'm working on implementing the authentication system" 
  ‚Üí Copilot suggests using `#updateContext`
- "I decided to use PostgreSQL for the database"
  ‚Üí Copilot suggests using `#logDecision` 
- "Show me what's in my progress file"
  ‚Üí Copilot suggests using `#showMemory`
- "I finished the login page and started on the dashboard"
  ‚Üí Copilot suggests using `#updateProgress`

### Direct Tool References  

You can also reference tools directly in your prompts:

- `#updateContext` Set active context to implementing user registration
- `#logDecision` decision:"Use React Query" rationale:"Better caching and state management"
- `#updateProgress` done:["Login page", "User model"] doing:["Dashboard"] next:["Admin panel"]
- `#showMemory` fileName:"decisionLog.md"
- `#switchMode` mode:"architect"

### Confirmation Flow

Each tool operation includes:
1. **Automatic suggestion** by Copilot based on context
2. **Clear confirmation dialog** showing what will be changed
3. **Rich feedback** confirming the operation completed

### Memory Files

Memory Bank creates and maintains these files in your project:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `activeContext.md` | Current goals and blockers |
| `productContext.md` | High-level project overview |
| `progress.md` | Done/doing/next tracking |
| `decisionLog.md` | Timestamped architecture decisions |
| `projectBrief.md` | High-level project requirements |
| `systemPatterns.md` | System design patterns and conventions |

## How to Use

### With GitHub Copilot Chat (Recommended)

1. Install the extension and open a workspace
2. Open GitHub Copilot Chat
3. Start talking naturally about your project:
   - "I'm working on the authentication system now"
   - "I decided to use MongoDB for the database" 
   - "Show me my current progress"
   - "Switch to debug mode"

Copilot will automatically suggest using Memory Bank tools when appropriate, with clear confirmation dialogs.

### With VS Code Chat (Fallback)

If Language Model Tools aren't available, the extension provides a chat participant:

1. Open the VS Code Chat panel (View > Chat)
2. Select "memory" from the chat selector dropdown
3. Say "hello" to initialize your memory bank and get current project summaries
4. The participant will guide you to use GitHub Copilot Chat for best results

**Note**: The fallback mode provides read-only access to memory bank summaries and recommends using GitHub Copilot Chat for full functionality.

### Manual Commands

Press `Ctrl+Alt+M` (or `Cmd+Alt+M` on Mac) to access Memory Bank commands directly:
- **Open GitHub Copilot Chat (Recommended)** - Use natural language with tool suggestions
- **Open VS Code Chat (Fallback)** - Use when Language Model Tools aren't available  
- **Show Memory Bank Status** - View current mode and activation status

**Note**: Individual slash commands like `/mb-init`, `/mb-update` have been replaced by the integrated tool system. Use GitHub Copilot Chat for the best experience.

## Working Modes

Memory Bank supports four specialized working modes:

| Mode | Description | Focus |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Architect** | Design system architecture | System design and key decisions |
| **Code** | Implement features | Code implementation and testing |
| **Ask** | Answer project questions | Knowledge retrieval |
| **Debug** | Identify and fix issues | Troubleshooting and fixes |

You can switch modes by:
1. Using GitHub Copilot Chat: "Switch to architect mode" 
2. Using the `#switchMode` tool directly
3. Clicking on the Memory Mode indicator in the status bar
4. Using the command palette: "Memory Bank: Select Mode"

## Example Workflow

```
üë§ User: "I'm starting work on the user authentication system"

ü§ñ Copilot: "I'll update your active context. Let me use the updateContext tool."
[Confirmation dialog: "Set active context to: implementing user authentication system?"]

üë§ User: "Yes"

ü§ñ Copilot: "‚úÖ Active context updated to: implementing user authentication system"

üë§ User: "I decided to use JWT tokens instead of sessions"

ü§ñ Copilot: "That's an important architectural decision. Let me log it using the logDecision tool."
[Confirmation dialog with decision and rationale]

üë§ User: "Yes, log it"

ü§ñ Copilot: "‚úÖ Decision logged: Use JWT tokens for authentication"
```
