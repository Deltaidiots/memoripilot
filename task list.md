- [ ] **Ask Mode Integration**
    - [ ] Access and explain content from memory bank files.
    - [ ] Update `productContext.md` or `systemPatterns.md` with new information gathered from interactions.

- [ ] **Debug Mode Integration**
    - [ ] Log identified issues and their resolutions in `decisionLog.md`.
